# I MUST
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/6EiNbg_nrbs
#### Description:
I Must is the web application made in Flask using JavaScript, Python and SQL 
with the help of libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap.

For the realisation I borrowed some helper-functions used for the CS50's pset9,
basically the whole register-login-logout mechanics, hope that's ok.

My web application keeps track of the things you want/need to do: so called
mustdo, mustbuy, mustread and mustwatch things, storing them in SQL database.

User can customize his experience a bit in the settings tab by using the page
loading for them by default via / route.

I implemented some cool things too - the "Watch" page suggests the name of the
show using specific imdb table from the local database and adds the rating
automatically if the movie is found in it.

I made some cool visual style too: font, boldness of the name of the current
page in the navigation bar, background picture and some more.

Enjoy!
