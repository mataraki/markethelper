            <p>Throughout my life I've been in a lot of things, let's break down some of them.</p>
            <p>First of all, I love videogames: I even did some esports and won a couple of regional Hearthstone tournaments.</p>
            <p>I love music, listen to it pretty much as long as I am awake (right now too). My wife presented me a launchkey on my last birthday and I'm planning to use it to make some tunes on my own.</p>
            <p>But the biggest, most important hobby of mine must be an intellectual games. There is a whole movement in <abbr title="Commonwealth of Independent States">CIS</abbr>, where people compete in multiple formats.
            Some of them resemble of worldwide popular such as quizes or Jeopardy, but the most famous is definitely What? Where? When?</p>
            <p>Inspired by the iconic everlasting russian show of the same name, this game assembles thousands of people to play and compete in pretty much every <abbr title="Commonwealth of Independent States">CIS</abbr> city and even further:
            New York, London, Jerusalem and many more.</p>
